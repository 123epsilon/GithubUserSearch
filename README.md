# GithubUserSearch
Simple webapp made using AngularJS which makes use of the Github API to provide a username search function.

This was originally a part of a larger test app made in order to learn AngularJS, however, I pulled this section of code because I thought the functionality was nice and it demonstrates some basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript ability. I wish I did have more time to spend on the design of the app itself, but that is ultimately something that can be iterated on in any development environment. The main goal of this mini-project was to make some real use of my Javascript knowledge as well as to gain some experience working with a RESTful API.

In order to run this web app I clone the repo locally and then use the python http.server module in order to locally host the files. The webapp provides a search function for GitHub users but no autofill functionality. It also includes a way to filter user repositories.
